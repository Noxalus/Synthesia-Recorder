# Synthesia Recorder

The purpose of this project is to be able to render a Synthesia video from a single MIDI file on a server.

Synthesia's creator has made a software called [Synthesia Video Creator](https://s3.amazonaws.com/synthesia/files/SynthesiaVideoCreator-10.4-win.zip) to record a video from a MIDI file without using graphic window, that's what I would like to use.

Unfortunately, Synthesia, and Synthesia Video Creator, are not available on Linux, and won't be ported for this platform.

It might be possible to do something using [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/), the problem is we can't even use Synthesia Video Creator with command lines, but [it's planned](https://www.synthesiagame.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=8144)!
